      <p>SPAM has become a big problem over the past few years. SPAM is unsolicited email sent by advertisers to your email address. In most cases, SPAM email is attempting to sell you something, however it could also contain malicious files and viruses, therefore caution should always be exercised when opening email from unknown parties. It's always a good idea to simply delete any emails that you suspect are SPAM.</p>

      <h3>The CAN-SPAM Law</h3>
      <p>In 2003 the US Congress passed the CAN-SPAM Act which attempts to reduce the amount of spam mail sent to individuals. The CAN-SPAM act does not make spam illegal, but it does place specific requirements on the email sent and gives rights to individuals who do not want to receive such email.</p>
      <p>The CAN-SPAM Act requires that senders of unsolicited email follow specific guidelines or face penalties by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Senders may not use false or misleading header information in their emails.
        <li>Sendesr may not use false or misleading subject lines.
        <li>The law requires that senders provide a way for recipients to opt-out from receiving any additional emails, and their opt-out requests must be honored.
        <li>The law also requires that commercial email be indentified and include valid physical postal address in the email.
      </ul>

      <h3>Reporting SPAM</h3>
      <p>The government provides stiff penalties to companies who violate the CAN-SPAM Act. Each violation is subject to fine up to $11,000. Illegal spam can be forwarded to spam@uce.gov. The email will be saved in a database which will be used by law enforcement to prosecute violators of the CAN-SPAM Act.</p>
